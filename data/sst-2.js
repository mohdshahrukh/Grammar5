The foolish bird thought that if he lived the life of the swan, swimming and dividing all day long and eating the weeds and plants that grow in the water, his feathers would turn white like the feathers of the swan. So he left his home in the woods and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes. He washed and washed his feathers all day long, almost drowning himself. But the feathers of the raven remained as black as ever. As the weeds he ate did not suit him, the body of the raven got thinner and thinner. It was only after he realised his foolishness that he stopped."
